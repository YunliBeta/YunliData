To: Supervisor R.M. Morozov

I hereby submit the final evaluation on the purifying effects of the new plant variety (hereinafter referred to as the "Experimental Plant") on Abyssal corruption. Please consider this letter my most formal request.

After months of controlled experiments, we have confirmed that the Experimental Plants demonstrate exceptional efficacy in processing high concentrations of Abyss corruption and (...) waste materials. In Experimental Site No. 2, the specimen successfully blocked all Abyssal corruption originating from outside the shelter within a short time frame, <color=#00E1FFFF>reflecting</color> it in a pure (...) form, thereby efficiently eliminating the monsters that had previously been extremely difficult to deal with. There is no doubt that this is an unprecedented breakthrough. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you have given us. This success is as much yours as it is ours.

However, I must also report the significant latent risks associated with such experiments. As I have repeatedly emphasized before, potential scenarios in which apocalyptic contamination could be released, and incidents of personnel casualties resulting from the escape of Abyssal monsters are all beyond the scope of our ability for subjective control. Among the most recent victims was even a child under (...) years old.

I am fully aware that Paiva's death from illness was in no way a tragedy you wished to witness, and that you exerted every effort to save that child. However, as long as experiments of this nature continue to advance, the risk of contamination leakage will only grow more severe. Our responsibility is to erect a barrier that shields humanity from catastrophe; under no circumstances should we seek to test the limits of that darkness. Forgive my bluntness, but the continuation of these experiments has become entirely meaningless — unless your intention (if I may speak frankly) is simply to permit even more otherworldly entities to pour into our shelter.

Based on the aforementioned reasons, and on behalf of the research team, I hereby submit the following request:

Immediately cease all further testing of the purification system.
Thoroughly eliminate all Abyssal live experimental specimens in our custody. Ensure that no monster collection activities are conducted in any form.

Please approve as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
