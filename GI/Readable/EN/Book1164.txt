■/■. This was my first mission under Captain Asapov. The real battlefield is nothing like the training grounds. When that monster threw itself at me, I could hear nothing but my own heart pounding. Everything I learned in training was gone. Fear flooded through me in an instant, my legs turning leaden. I never knew battles could be so terrifying. I could barely hold my sword.\nI woke up several times in the middle of the night, gasping for air inside my tent. It feels as if the Wild Hunt will strike the moment I lose focus. Chinnov saved me this time, but what about the next? Will I be wounded, or will I die?\nI worked so hard to become a Ratnik, dreaming of standing beside the legends. Yet look at me now. I cannot even keep my grip on a blade when facing the Wild Hunt. Will I ever see my mother's warm smile again? Will I ever return to Nasha Town, the place from which I first set out?
