"Always remember, Avrelian, my dear child â€” the one precious gift that fate has granted me."
"A thousand-year-old curse runs through your veins, and my only wish is for you to live a life of peace and joy."
"No matter what happens, you must never set foot in Nod-Krai, and you must never be taken in by that fool's dream of 'Elysium.'"
"No earthly paradise under the moon has ever been built for mortals. All that the Lord of the Sky has created has its boundaries."

On a snowy evening gently veiled in the aurora's light, the woman once worshipped as the Maiden had another glimpse of the dream visions foretelling the fate of her homeland.
It had been many years since she bade farewell to her homeland. Yet, like wet snow, those deliberately forgotten whispers always found their way into her warm, quiet dreams nevertheless.
Perhaps it was the new life growing within her that stirred the long-dormant visions, and now, those haunting, twisting phantoms grew ever clearer...

At first, they came to her as ceaseless nightmares, countless dreams that came and went endlessly in stifling and unyielding cycles.
The Seeds of Life, born not of nature's evolution, fell from silver branches into the ruins of the desolate city,
where featherless bipeds began to enjoy untold wisdom and the blessings it bestowed.
Then came endless greed and selfish desire, each masked behind noble-sounding names,
and from them followed hatred, curses, betrayal, strife, plunder, slaughter, and kin turning against kin.
The cities scattered across the land pursued their own paths of good and evil while the divine envoy stood by in silence, watching all unfold.
Then, the kings of the lands dared test the eternal heavens,
and only then did the great towers fall into flame, burying the cries of the long-suffering slaves.

Like a fleeting shadow vanishing in a single breath, a dreamless dream stretched across a thousand years and then a thousand more,
a dream of crowns piled deep and unclaimed in secret realms beneath trees withered and poor.
But sometimes the divine plan can falter, and the golden city that rose from the earth
could not still the hearts of mortals aflame with desire,
hearts swollen with ambition, drawn to the vacant throne of the world, longing to shatter the line between man and god.
But like all tragic illusions, that boundless paradise will crumble,
the kings of flame will fall into the dark fog, and the tides will eventually swallow the empires of white stone whole.
The dying world was moving toward its end, with only the shadows of the past lingering in its halls.

Countless dreams steeped in blood, tears, and sin... Countless dreams, forever out of reach...
Years of division and hate, carried across generation after generation, cycling endlessly beneath the starless night.
Yet, a voice she had never known, more familiar than any she had ever heard,
would always whisper to her at the edge of darkness and pain, with a compassion as soft and luminous as light.

"In this case, I shall bring an end to the warriors of this land and raise a boundless paradise in their place."
"I do this not to become a king, but to ensure that no one else can ever call themselves one again."

Her dream would always shatter just as it reached the moment of promise, and she would be pulled back to the shores of reality,
accompanied by the pale morning light and the faint stirring of life within her.
The young mother let out a quiet sigh as her fingers brushed against the silvery-white talisman resting against her chest.
Gazing upon the face of the one she loved next to her, the woman gently placed a hand over her lower belly and asked,

"My child, my dear child... why do you stir so?"
"Do you stir because you can sense your mother's heart, and so you feel afraid?"
