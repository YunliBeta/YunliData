To: Supervisor R.M. Morozov

Another person <color=#FF5E41FF>[REDACTED]</color> died. How many more deaths do you want to see? Stop this <color=#FF5E41FF>[REDACTED]</color> experiment immediately, or I will <color=#FF5E41FF>[REDACTED]</color> your <color=#FF5E41FF>[REDACTED]</color> and feed it to <color=#FF5E41FF>[REDACTED]</color>.

I know you saw it, Morozov. Stop playing dead.
