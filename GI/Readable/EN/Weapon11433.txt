Once upon a time, whispered tales spoke of bloodthirsty spirits haunting the cold forest veiled in frost and mist.
Legend told of a malevolent spirit, swift to anger, that spared no one who entered the forest.
Even the overbearing soldiers of Northland and the most raucous bandits of the tundra
would fall silent at the mention of Niflheimâ€™s desolation. They would instinctively lower their voices, 
as if fearing the low hum behind them might be the last sound they would ever hear.

Very few knew that the hum came not from an evil spirit, but from the keen edge of a blade wielded by an unknown hunter.
The hunter was an exile, a silent one whose name appeared in no records and who had never fought for any ideal or banner.
But for the children who had lost their kin in those turbulent times and fled to the cold forest,
clutching a conch as their only token of trust, he simply killed every villain that appeared in those woods.
The cold metal of the blade can never mimic the echo of the conch, just like how the past can never be reclaimed.
Yet the warmth that bloomed at the villains' necks was enough to silence the wicked, preserving the children's peaceful dreams.

Across the days of the gentry and the old Tsar and through the protracted struggle for a new world,
the wandering hunter stayed silent, his only constant the whistle that hunted in the cold nights.
It was only when the frozen woods were emptied of all the lost children
and the aged guardian himself had forgotten how to speak
did the hunter finally lay down his blade. He then turned toward the deepest part of the forest and vanished, never to be seen again.
