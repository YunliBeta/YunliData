Day 24. Still no sign of night or day, still no wind.

I saw more monsters today, and it looked like they were of the same species. They resembled the one that almost devoured us, but there were larger ones and smaller ones. The largest of them all was the size of a small mountain.

Judging by the range of the monsters' activities, I'm starting to suspect that the place we went to earlier was not the center of the Mare, but merely somewhere along its edge. Despite all our efforts, we never even got close to the heart of the Mare...

And something else happened today that I thought was strange, so I'm writing it down. I remember seeing a woman bandaging my wounds, but when I try to recall what she looked like, it's like my mind's eye is covered in ash. I can't make out any of the details...
The only thing I can remember is her name... "Nana," I think it was.
