"When the Evermoon falls, the world turns upside down."
"When the Iridescent Moon shatters, the red shadow plunges into the abyssal sea."
"When the Frostmoon stops moving, the nations perish."
A world no longer watched over by Eternity nears its end.
"Until paradise dawns and begins to turn the primordial wheel."

Following an ancient prophecy, the descendants of the Golden City erected a lonely temple on the desolate tundra.
For millennia, the moonlight has quietly streamed through the frosty forest. The descendants of the north still uphold their ancient rituals,
forging pale ceremonial crowns from secret silver and choosing the purest high priests to guide their people.
Just like in the days of old, they continue their prayers and chants, though their gods are long departed and the sky no longer answers.

An outsider might regard these practices as the actions of the foolish clinging to the old ways.
Yet these prayers and sacrifices, passed down for millennia, form the only sacred bond for a people who have lost their homeland.
The spinning wheel of fate has rusted, and the silver thread has grown dim. Relying on prophetic visions alone will not bring true hope to all.
"Who would worship a dead god, or endure such hopeless suffering for an empty dream?"
Just as the ages return in cycles, the ignorant continue to yearn for tangible guidance.
This is why these rituals have become their great isolation, a high wall that keeps them unseen and unknown to the world beyond.

So it has been for thousands of years, and so it shall remain for thousands more.
And so it shall remain, until the pure bloodline, refined through generations, produces the sacred heir who will make the world fall to its knees. And when that happensâ€¦
All lies and sins will be forgiven, even praised, for they all serve the pure paradise beneath the moon.

What follows is the sacred journey of the Frostmoon Scions, who are at last no longer turning away outsiders.
The first Moonchanter, a saint graced by the divine and the one who witnessed the birth of God, was once the mortal Aila.
According to stories passed down by later generations, she foresaw the new moon's birth and, moved by divine revelation, chose to abandon the old rites.
"They are the Chosen One: blessed from birth, a soul untouched by the world's countless corruptions."
"She saw the spinning wheel was silent and the silver thread full of despair, for millennia of praise had become nothing more than a hollow echo."
"The fading glory never pitied the desolate borderlands. Now, only the new moon, on the cusp of its birth, holds the promise of true hope."
"Aila's devotion earned her the admiration of even the last High Priest of the Far North, who opened his heart to her without hesitation."
"With all my heart, I entrust her with the authority to lead our people. I also grant her the honor of sealing the ancient sanctuary with her own hands."
"Let us bury the old glory and cast aside the hollow titles and meaningless past as we await the birth of the new god."
The High Priest of Hyperborea was no more from that moment on. Only the Moonchanter remained standing in the light of pure radiance.

...

Countless moons rose and fell. Those who dreamed of paradise found only the shadow of the axe, while those who longed for salvation were swept away by the flowing light.
The mad monk who reached for the heavens was consumed by his vision, and the old master of the throne on the Pale Star is gone, while the White Emperor also fell into the churning black waves.
At last, even the nightingales fell silent. Countless names faded from the mortal world, becoming echoes that the living were left to remember, judge, and forget.
As promised to the Torchforger, the new moon's maiden spun the prayer song and laid it to rest with the sanctuary.
And there it lays until the Whitenight erases the final witnesses of that era. Only the moonlight remains, flowing quietly just as it had a thousand years before.

"When the Evermoon falls, the world turns upside down."
"When the Iridescent Moon shatters, the red shadow plunges into the abyssal sea."
"When the Frostmoon stops moving, the nations perish."
"A world no longer watched over by Eternity nears its end."
"Until the new moon rises to turn the spinning wheel of fate."
"Those who follow the tides still sing their songs and offer their prayers."
"For the new moon will return, precisely as the ancients have foretold."
