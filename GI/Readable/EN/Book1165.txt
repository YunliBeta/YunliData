■/■. Around four this morning, I was jolted awake by waves of roaring, the ground shaking beneath me. The air carried an acrid, bloody smell. When I looked outside the camp, I saw countless monsters rushing toward us in the dark. Captain Asapov burst out of his tent and began shouting orders. My foggy mind slowly understood that this was a Wild Hunt attack.\nWhat surprised me was the flood of images that suddenly flashed through my head. Some were from the training grounds, some from my first night with the support unit, and some from long ago in my home. For a moment, I even thought I smelled the ribs my mother used to cook.\nI do not know why all those memories filled my head at once, but I am grateful that fear was no longer the only thing in my heart. This was the first time I fought with the squad to clear a Wild Hunt nest. Even now, my heart still pounds, and my arms feel numb with exhaustion. I was injured in the fight, but I was not as terrified as on that night. Maybe I really will grow into the person I hope to become. I hope so.
