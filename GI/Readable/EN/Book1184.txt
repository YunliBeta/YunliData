...This is a secret mission that only me and Big Sis Grażyna know about!

...Once these flowers grow up, Little Pai will come back to play with us!

...Grażyna said she's just sick and needs to rest for a while. When the flowers grow taller than my knees, she'll recover, so we mustn't cry. We need to listen to Uncle Morozov and be very good children.

...There's no sun here, but the lights up there are just as warm and cozy. As long as we water them with that shimmering water every day, these flowers will surely grow quickly!

...Grow faster, please. I miss her.
