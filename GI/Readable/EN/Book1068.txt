Day 14. I don't know whether it's day or night. There's no wind.
I thought I was going to die. The monster ate my left hand and part of my waist. I don't know where I dropped my medicine, so I can't treat my wounds.
But today might be my lucky day. I didn't expect to meet a man here. He calls himself Nocht, and he used a flower that blossomed among the ashes to stop my bleeding. He even warned me about getting close to the beasts, because they would eat even their own kind.
...
I asked him where he was from. He said he comes from a place called "Tenochzitoc"...
But that's not his hometown. It's strange that he doesn't remember where he was born, but who am I to question him?
...
Nocht left without taking a rest. He said he was running out of time.
He warned me to head back before it was too late. Heh... With my body in its current state, it might be too late already.
I am prepared. I know this is my last adventure. In the name of the Great Adventurer, Stanley, I swear to use every last drop of blood in my body to uncover the secrets of this place.
...
Hans, as long as you can make it back to Mondstadt safely, then I'll know my efforts have not been in vain.
If a day should come where another member of the Guild can come back here, I hope they can find the records I've left behind.
Ad astra abyssosque.
