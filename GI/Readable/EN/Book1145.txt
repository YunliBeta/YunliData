Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown...
We encountered another group of monster hunters. They called themselves the "Lightkeepers" and seemed to have come from the north...
These warriors, intent on restoring order to this land, invited us to join their cause. But Master Roland refused...
"Nothing will ever change unless this land is cleansed with blood." That's what the Master said...
And the targets of this purge are not limited to non-human monsters. He believes that bandits who seize the chance to pillage, and desperate outlaws with nowhere left to turn... All must be eradicated.
But can this world truly be saved through killing alone...?
