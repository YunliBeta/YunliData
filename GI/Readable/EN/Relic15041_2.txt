To overstep the bounds of one's station is already an act of disloyalty, if not outright treason.
To delve into the forbidden dark knowledge is an even graver offense.

But Rausvang never tries to defend himself, for in his heart he holds nothing but that light.
Soon, the court delivers its verdict: the researcher is to be expelled from the Universitas Magistrorum and exiled.
For an outlander like him, exile was even more terrifying than the punishment of death.
Exile is, after all, an ancient curse for those who have turned their backs on the gods, and once they return to solid ground, the gods will inevitably catch up with them.
A punishment like this is a betrayal of the kingdom’s noble ideals, and a sign of an underground realm in decline.

But the Tsar's orders must be obeyed. Besides, those who have lived in paradise know all too well that they can no longer endure what lies ahead.
"Fade away, o meaningless life. At least, in the end, you get a glimpse of the truth."
Rausvang finally emerges from the cavern and steps into the true sunlight.
Yet, nothing happens to him — unlike the others beside him, who are now crying out in sheer agony.

It is as if the great existence of the cosmos has manifested before him,
and chosen, above all others, to bestow upon him the grace of darkness.
Fortunately, but also tragically, he finally comes to realize his mission.
