Manou, I'd call you dumb as a sick pig, but that'd be an insult to pigs.
The painter I asked you to nab is named KANEI, not ZHAKA! This Zhaka guy's just an apprentice, and he can't make anything useful!
The quality of these dolls is so poor that you can tell at a glance that they're fake. Go find some pigs even sillier than you, and get rid of these goods at a discount.
If you can't handle even that, I'm hiring an actual pig to replace you.
