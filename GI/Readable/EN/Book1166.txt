■/■. The unit assignments came out today. Perhaps luck really does balance itself. I was not chosen for a frontline Lightkeeper unit. Instead, I was assigned to a support unit stationed at Kipumaki Cliff. I should have known better than to hope for too much. With my test scores, being accepted as a Lightkeeper at all was already more than I could've hoped for. Today I met my captain and my teammates for the first time. Captain Asapov is a stone-faced man. He gave me a brief rundown of our duties, patted my shoulder, and went back to his post. His grip was so strong I almost lost my balance. Chinnov is a cheerful fellow. He pulled me to the campfire for drinks, and I had a surprisingly pleasant night. Schonovich is as thin as a sheet of iron. I heard he used to be a poet. Chinnov says his dream is to write a great poem about military life, which is why he became a Lightkeeper. To be honest, he is a strange one. Patolichev joined the same day as I did, and he seems downcast for some reason. I wonder if his reason for being thus is the same as mine.
