■/■. The captain received an order from Piramida today. We are to clear several Wild Hunt nests around Kipumaki Cliff in a support unit role. To be honest, this is the best news I have had in days. No, in months. At last, I will go to the battlefield. At last, I can prove myself. Filyaev the Lightkeeper, remembered by the generations to come, is finally about to have his first battle!
