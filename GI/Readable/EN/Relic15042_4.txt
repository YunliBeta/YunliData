That was a time when the gentle frost light still lingered, a silver mirror unbroken, even as the golden realm had already fallen.
In a single night, the golden tower fell like it was a fig tree. Across the frozen northern plain,
from the holy city to the ancient capital, dark blue crystal nails annihilated every single city with every the most minuscule sign of life.
The once-praised saint and the gods’ first messenger both vanished in the catastrophe.
Those who survived, because they were nowhere near the cities at the time, could only cling to life in the freezing wind and snow.
With no refuge left, they simply waited for destruction to find them in the hollow dark.

This is the great extinction spoken of in later prayers. Prosperity turned to dust,
and the gods remained silent, unmoved by cries, curses, or desperate pleas.
In the despair of that long night, only one celestial mistress shed tears for the mortals' pain.
She was the mistress of the Frostmoon, queen of the celestial chariot and light, a heavenly agent born from the world's own source.
Moved by pity, and a deeper, unspoken wish, she heeded the survivors' prayers.

According to legend, she spun gleaming threads from the silver glow to lead the displaced across the frozen plains.
And where her tears, full of longing, fell upon the frost-covered soil of the north, they blossomed into lilies that would stand eternal in the icy winds.
The proud descendants of Hyperborea call themselves the “Frostmoon Scions” for this reason,
and to honor the gods who, whatever their original purpose, gave humanity a new lease of life.
