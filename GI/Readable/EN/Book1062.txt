No existent records suggest how the Mare Jivari could have disappeared. It seems that all related information was erased alongside the sea of ash itself.
The only speculation that remains to be made comes from an ancient legend:
"Thousands of years ago, a troupe wandered through the lands."
"For flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows. They performed not only for friends, but also for foes."
"They traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari."
But mainstream history dictates that the Mare Jivari only appeared five hundred years ago.
Assuming the records of this ancient troupe's heyday are accurate, it would suggest a phenomenon of temporal disruption in the Mare Jivari.
Temporal disruption... time...
Could the transcendent power of the Abyss threaten even the flow of time?
