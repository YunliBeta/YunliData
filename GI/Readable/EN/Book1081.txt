My dear Little Bone Captain, today is your lucky day.
Word from Nasha Town: Some of the nobles have got a new whim rattling about in their heads — they want a glimpse of those funky Monetoo from Tenochtzitoc. If you and your crew succeed in capturing one, we might reconsider our claiming of your spine... among other pesky personal debts.
I'm sure you won't turn down such a generous offer.
Of course, just for safety's sake, we've already sent Icahua ahead to the resort. He'll be watching your every move until your triumphant return.
Yours sincerely, Black Reef Rekis.
(...At the end of the letter is a line of angry writing...)
