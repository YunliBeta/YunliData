I've been tricked. I've been tricked. I've been tricked. There's no treasure. There was never any damn treasure in this cursed place. That signal was deliberately set as bait. I should have known. The terminal was placed in such an obvious spot. If there really was treasure here, we would've heard all about this place in Nasha Town. But no one has ever mentioned it.

I mean, no one who's been here has lived to tell about it.

The door is sealed, and the elevator has left. I guess only activating this (some unrecognizable vulgar word) purification system from the outside can reopen the door. There's no way out. No way out ever again. I'm going to die here. I don't want to die here. I shouldn't have joined the Seahook Gang. I should have taken the work from those overfed and self-indulgent Fontainians instead. I'll (...) anyone, I don't care how many it takes. I don't care who I (...). As long as I don't die here.

When he opens the door, I'll grab my knife and (...) him, take his belongings, and escape this place. I will survive. I won't starve to death here. I won't die. Haha. I won't die.

...

Something's not right.

Come to think of it, since I came in, I haven't seen a single (...).

No, this isn't right. I couldn't possibly be the first person to wander into this place. If that signal has been broadcasting all this time, then plenty of people must have come in already. There are plenty of marks carved by Treasure Hoarders in the corners of the walls, too, though I can't make any sense of what they mean.

Could it be that there's still...
