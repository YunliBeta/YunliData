The ship's doctor said Sharmey needed more time to recover, so I returned to the children's cabin. Shalomiya was awake — I knew it might be traumatic for her to think back to what happened, but I had to get to the bottom of the night's events.
But when I asked, what she told me shattered my heart. Even now, I can barely believe it. As I write this, my hands are shaking. It... It was Shalomiya! It was Shalomiya who locked her sister in that dark prison of a cargo crate! This wasn't just some prank! This was something far worse. She had to be punished! No matter what else may have happened, nothing could ever justify doing something as horrifying as this!

Shalomiya cried as she begged me to forgive her. She said if she hadn't done what she did, Sharmey would have left her. She claimed that Sharmey was the child of a fae. That she wanted to return to her people's world. That the monster that took the passenger was probably Sharmey's kin... Nonsense! Absurd nonsense! There can be no doubt that Sharmey is a human child no different than Shalomiya... Then again, are there not fae that can transform? A terrifying doubt took root in my heart, before I tore it up and discarded it. Shalomiya's impressionable mind must have been affected by reading unsuitable stories — just like that lullaby, "Mama in the Sheepfold"...

Even now, I'm unsure if I should write a letter to the children's father, informing him of Shalomiya's wicked deed. I can't say what doing so would mean for Shalomiya... There is no time left to write today — I shall decide what to do tomorrow.
