Truth takes time to build, but lies can be created overnight.
If slander continues to spread, the foundations of trust will be eroded.
Even the strongest oath of loyalty will not survive amid suspicion.
Exploiting the arrogance of the nobility, allowing hatred to grow and spread,
Thus lending opportunity to the most deeply hidden evil intentions.
This is the second of his three great sins.

With a stone pillar as its seal, and a spell as its shroud,
Let the evidence of the Serpent of All Evils' crimes be inscribed within the lantern's shade.
