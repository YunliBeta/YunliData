Blood-red wine gleamed in golden cups, water-hued jade lay upon pale braids.
Bare feet no longer tread slivers of silver snow; only slivered silver fall about her feet like snow.
Beneath the shadow of the towering spire, amidst a prison of delusive enchantment, the huntress believed herself cherished by a tyrant.
Consider the wandering craftsman who proffered to her a clockwork bird of pure gold, begging only for his life.
Both his hands were hewn away by her King's cold, sharp wind, lest such a toy ever be made again for another’s delight.

When the bloodline, long-steeped in ignorance, bowed down to the wrathful wind, offering her like a sacrifice to the king of the spire,
the huntress, who once roosted with owls on withered boughs and danced with hawks across the plains,
knew not that the Lord of Wind, feared by all, would elevate her to the place of favored counsel, so skilled was she with the bow.
Before she met her king, she knew not the tenderness of love, nor the searing sting of hate.
Before she met her king, no human heart had ever stirred within the huntress treading the plains.

If there are those born with dreams of kindness and liberty, yearning to cleave the wind-wrought wall of desolation with their song,
And if even Gods may be ensnared by their own delusion and conceit, doomed to drown in the barren dream called eternity,
Then there are those, born wanting, only able to fill their hollow hearts with blind devotion.





















Awoken from blind love, she realized she was the only one who spoke with sincerity.









For he spoke of love, but was only accompanied by razor winds.




— Thus spoke one, a mortal knowing naught of love, to a god who could not know it.
Even in the moment they tore each other apart, neither had ever truly known the other’s heart.
