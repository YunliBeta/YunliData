In the great many halls of Zapolyarny Palace, the banquets and dances never seem to stop.
The fae nobles, fond of luxury, consider attending banquets their most important duty.
Even the hardest heart can be softened by the rich aroma of fine wine...
And many important affairs of state, both great and small, are often decided by those in a slight tipsy haze.

Professor Hortwoong, whom the nobles call the "mad monk" in private, has attended the court rather frequently of late.
This isn't just because he has become the Tsaritsa's favored retainer through his mastery of alchemy and astrology,
nor simply because he constantly utters profound aphorisms that inevitably send everyone in the room into laughter.
What has truly made the nobles sit up and take notice are the legends that surround him.

It is said that the Grand Duke Futhius once, out of envy, sought to get rid of this troublesome viper.
He replaced the fine fire-water with a deadly poison... But to his astonishment, the good professor appeared completely unaffected after drinking it.
In the end, the grand duke himself took a knee to the monk, and even became the latter's most devoted follower.

Another tale has it that Filipov, the most adept of the faes at the art of transformation, once publicly called the professor's research nothing more than an elaborate hoax.
The monk responded to the accusation with nothing but a calm smile. Then, before everyone's eyes, he summoned the soul of Filipov's late wife â€” the very one who had been appearing in the bereaved fae's dreams.
These tales have become a favorite topic of banquet chatter. But whenever someone tries to confirm their truth, the professor has remained silent.
Perhaps no one truly cares whether these stories are true. Maybe they exist simply to entertain banquet guests between songs and dances.

Or perhaps, to the nobles, an outlander with no local ties is actually more worthy of their trust.
Of course, it would be even better if he could lend them a hand with other issues.
But how could the protagonist of this drama have foreseen his tragic fate coming?
