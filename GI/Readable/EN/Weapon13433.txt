How many rains must fall upon a seed before it bears fruit?
How many choices must one make in life to find the way to happiness?
There are things even the gods may not know. Yet, we mortals must struggle for them, at the price of our entire lives.
At this moment, a choice laid before Suibhne, the son of a poor farmer, and he could not help but tighten his grip on the shovel in his hand.

A secret treasure had been unearthed from the tired, hollowed soil. If he could sell it on the black market, he would be able to escape a life of poverty.
A ragged man with a treasure in his hands is bound to draw greedy eyes. With the brutal winter closing in, he has no choice but to take this precarious step.
With a uniform as his tool, the clever peasant made his first deal. It was a disguise he used to fool everyone and drive away any lurking threat.
Suibhne was revelling in the deal when a dark shadow appeared. It was the same man who had sold him his uniform: the thief.
"Hand over the treasure, or this wilderness will be your final resting place!" Forced under the blade, the peasant complied.
The two came to the field where the treasure lay hidden. The thiefâ€™s gaze fell on a jagged piece of black spine bone, and a sudden thrill ignited within him.
"Surely these are the remains of the master thief," he said, lifting the bone with trembling hands. He was unaware that in this moment, he had sealed his own fate.
With a heavy thud, a shovel drove the thief into the earth. In that moment, Suibhne knew he had to leave the farm for good.

The now-bloodied treasure had opened a perilous path to the very summit of the black market, a path Suibhne continued to march on with grim resolve.
Today, he is regarded as a kind of godfather figure to the desperate criminals who flock here, lured by the sweet scent of fortune.
"Oh most esteemed Godfather, your wisdom is the only light we follow. The black market is honored to count you as one of our own!"
Yet, no one really knows why a worn-out shovel, of all things, rests upon the Godfather's throne.

In those blood-soaked times, he kept the shovel as a constant reminder that for a robber, death was always a hair's breadth away.
Now, countless treasures lie buried among the border reefs. Each one is a potential token, to be traded for loyalty and fear.
He no longer wastes time agonizing over choices, for his power and wealth can correct any misstep.
The world is governed by a hidden law, an unstoppable cycle in which the rich grow richer and the poor sink ever deeper into hardship.
The Godfather of today is no wiser than the poor peasant he once was, and no different from the thief who once tried to kill him.
"Then why? Why is it that the treasure my shovel unearths is mine, yet the one it buries is someone else???"
Was it all nothing more than chance, that is, he was simply born a little luckier than the thief who met his end that day?
A thousand choices and a lifetime of sacrifice, all made in pursuit of happiness. Yet in the end, it was chance that really determined everything.

A wave of disgust washes over Suibhne at the sheer injustice of it all. "This is where all my treasures are," he mutters.
He reveals his treasure map to the public. Now, anyone in the borderlands can vie for the prize, armed with nothing but their own capabilities.
Let them succeed or fail. Either way, Suibhne cares not how their stories will end.
The Godfather, draped in finery yet still gripping a shovel, has come to understand the kind of justice Reed Miller preached:

"If imbalance is the law of this world, let gold find its way to gold, and let earth return to earth."
"If this world needs a hand to restore its order and balance, then that hand must belong to the thief."
