If power were a majestic edifice, how many bricks are needed to make it a reality?
Bricks alone do not make a building. The question is, who decides which bricks will form the foundation, and which will become the spire?
Beneath the facade of strict order lies the truth: sheer chance alone arbitrarily decides the fate of every brick.
A towering building can be brought down by a single crucial brick, the one that will not obey the false order.

"The Godfather’s secret treasure lies deep within the black market." The feast to shatter the old order has begun, and hungry thieves are now gathering for the prize.
This is a battle of all against all. The most fatal threat comes not from the Godfather's men but the ruthless thieves themselves.
A fae was the first to enter the treasure vault. Their world had taught him to seek out gain, shun personal harm, and keep a distance from the schemes of others.
He was cunning beyond measure, able to read people’s minds like maps and navigate the safest paths through the most tangled of intrigues.
The next to make an attempt was a young lady for whom winning against the fae mattered more than the riddles laid by the Godfather.
With her blade, she adroitly cut through every lock, outwitting the supposedly intricate mechanisms with the simplest of solutions.
The last to face the challenge was a hunter, who saw the maze not as a riddle, but as a hunting ground demanding every bit of his caution.
Patience is a poisoned trap, and sharpness a bloodthirsty blade. Guided by his raw, primal skills, the hunter met the challenge head-on.

Yet all were defeated before the treasure vault — the fae, the young lady, and the hunter alike.
A butler in black bound the three and led them, one by one, into an inner chamber.
"Esteemed Godfather, your guests have been seated and now await your command."
With Zaytun peach in hand, the Godfather leisurely chews as he says to each of the guests brought in by the butler thusly:

"You have shown no regard for the world's order and dared to take what was not yours. And for that, I intend to reward you."
"Order, as it is known, exists only to serve its architects. I find this completely unacceptable, which is why I'll be needing your help."
"What this world calls order is just the rich getting richer and the poor being left with less. I have concluded that thievery is the only way to restore balance."
"Should you choose to uphold the thief's code from this day forward, eat this fruit in the presence of the master thief’s remains."
Having longed since childhood to escape the hollow luxury of noble life, the fae was moved by the Godfather's words and ate the Bulle Fruit to accept his offer.
The young lady, who had never bowed to the arrogance of those above her, swallowed the Wolfhook without hesitation, for her philosophy was fully in line with that of the Godfather.
The last to swallow the fruit, the Valberry, was the hunter, who had once retreated into the cold forest rather than live in compromise with a corrupt world.
"Excellent. The pact is sealed. From this day forward, you are the backbone of the resistance against injustice."

After watching his guests leave one by one, the Godfather gently ran a hand along the bare vault walls, lost in reflection.
He had removed the most crucial brick from the edifice of order, yet he could not foresee what would come next.
As the Godfather clutched his stomach and frowned, the butler beside him smiled serenely to himself.
With the utmost calm, she took the master thief's black spine bone, leaving the detoxifying Calla Lily behind as she swiftly exited.

"What you just said to the other thieves has finally made me understand the master thief’s ideals. For that reason, I shall spare your life."
"True justice lies not in order itself, but in the simple truth that no single person can ever impose it on others."
