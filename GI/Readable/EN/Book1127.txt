In the end, all fervent, noble, and futile dreams will dissolve like tears,
like the countless fantasies born in the past, disappearing with the piercing cold wind.
Whether born of true good intentions or the self-indulgent romantic fantasies,
All paths lead to the same end. No one can escape a reality that falls short of their dreams, leaving their story to be edited by others.

The prophesied ruler who never came to rule did not live to witness his Elysium, a place where all sorrows were swept away.
His borderless dream world had become a thing for bandits to make sport of.
The usurper, who never became the sacred heir, could not break the chains binding kin,
Leaving behind a maid, herself now left with nothing, to sing evening prayers in mourning beneath the Nightingale's Spire.
The Governor's adopted son, who never became a master thief, failed to save the life of the one he loved,
And instead stole the false name of a forgotten commoner, pretending to be a hero who now posed no threat.

But what did it matter? The world she longed for was simply one where everyone could laugh as they willed.
Even if it was all an insubstantial, ludicrous falsehood, it was still proof that their dreams had come true.
A fake is not worthless. Just like these tokens you've found, even though they are but my counterfeit work,
And not echoes surging within Ley Lines, they can still guide you to our great treasure.

Since grandiose histories will only record the stories of the nobles,
Let me inscribe the names of the lowly in the way taught by she who heralds the new moon.
As the one I love but cannot possess once scolded, I have no profound thoughts,
And this is but the mockery of a wretched wanderer, raised to the high heavens.
