It was during the time when the frosty light had shattered like a silver mirror, and the new moon had yet to rise.
This is the story of two sisters who, born as imperfect outcasts, were never meant to be blessed.

In the moonlight, an undisturbed sanctuary for strangers, two fragile souls shared a single breath.
In the brief moments between pain, moments that should have been filled with joy, they huddled together, drawing what little warmth they could from each another.
They had never seen their parents, and nor had they ever heard the whispers of the wind passing through the forest.
The two of them had only their grandmother, and the only way they'd seen the world was through the pages of a faded storybook.

Its brittle, yellowed pages, torn and frayed, revealed to them a world they'd never seen:
there it was, a single white bird, a streak of grace, gliding beneath a perfect moon.
As they admired the free creatures of the fairy tales, the two children made a quiet promise to each other...
One day, the two of them would fly together like the white birds in the vast sky.

"Since the day we were born, it's always been just the two of us."
"When the day comes for us to leave, let’s live the rest of our lives together."

Years and years pass, and then one of them broke their promise, leaving for a faraway place alone.
This, sadly, wasn't a flight toward a brighter future, but a fall into a much darker night.
With her went half the dream, and half the pain that was meant for them both.
Aila, later to become the first Moonchanter, began to endure twice the torment from that day on.

"So you lied to me all along... my older sister, the only one I ever truly trusted."
"But I won't resent you… I've long since lost hope for the sky beyond."
