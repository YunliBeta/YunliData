"O little dove, child of the moon,"
"Though dust may stain your fair white feathers,"
"Though you lie down not in a warm embrace,"
"May the moon be with you in your slumber."

A shattered husk falls toward the misty land that never became a moon, their blessings scattered into clear waters and mossy plains.
In a prison beyond the reach of both Time and Wind, the one who traverses backward beholds the eternal slumber of three sisters.
In the eternal and fleeting, unbound by start or cease, the imprisoned Moon Maiden drifts through the night,
Her consciousness gently caressing the hazy, ethereal memories woven in the tapestry of yesteryears…




























"O little dove, child of the moon,"
"Let not sorrow for hardship or parting weigh upon your heart,"
"The flowers will bloom once more by your window,"
"And the moon will be with you in your slumber, tomorrow."
