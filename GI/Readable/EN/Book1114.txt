The data from the tenth experiment on the barrier generator's stability has been fully compiled. Results remain unsatisfactory: energy is still depleting too quickly.

We relocated to a different test site, but a Landcruiser was damaged due to an operational error. It was a chaotic scene. Although the data was successfully recovered, additional time had to be spent on filing the incident report.

The new barrier prototype has arrived â€” it's now a third of its original size. Initial testing was conducted this morning, and performance was found to be within acceptable limits. However, the energy durability bottleneck remains a problem.

The energy consumption model was modified, resulting in an improved goodness of fit.

Disappointingly, my transfer request has been denied. But I suppose that's not surprising at all. I mean, that project is highly classified, and access is granted to only a select few.
If more funding were available, perhaps you wouldn't have to share the space with those tinkering with plants or animals. Who knows? Maybe we could even come up with something a bit more convincing...
