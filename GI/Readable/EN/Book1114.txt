The data from the tenth experiment on the barrier generator's stability has been fully compiled. Results remain unsatisfactory as energy is still depleting too quickly.
...
The experiment was relocated to a different site, but a Landcruiser became damaged due to an operational error. It was chaos. Although the data was successfully recovered, additional time had to be spent on filing the incident report.

The new barrier prototype has arrived, and it's now a third of its original size. Initial testing was conducted this morning, and performance was found to be within acceptable limits. However, energy availability over time continues to be a problem.
...
The energy consumption model was modified, resulting in an improved goodness of fit.

Disappointingly, my transfer request has been denied. But I suppose that's not surprising at all. I mean, that project is highly classified, and access is granted to only a select few.
If more funding were available, perhaps you wouldn't have to share the space with those who tinker with plants or animals. Who knows? Maybe we could even come up with something a bit more convincing...
