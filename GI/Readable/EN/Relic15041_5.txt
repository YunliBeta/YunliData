It was a time before the dark disaster engulfed the nations,
a time when people were still savoring their last golden years.

It is said that there was an erudite and gifted researcher who wandered the nations for many years.
He'd already read all the chronicles of the Rtawahists, as well as browsed through the libraries of Northland.
However, even after searching in the oldest records, he could not find what he was looking for.
It was a pitch-black paradise — miraculous, and not of this world.

He had traveled to every corner of the known world, save for that barren land still untouched by development.
That is the northern borderland known as Nod-Krai. It was only a few years ago that the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya ordered it to be explored and brought into use.
In that borderland there were no famous researches, and nor were there any traces of ancient civilization.

"This is the very last place I can look. What an utterly futile life I have lived,"
he thought before he set off for Nod-Krai.
"Hope may be gone, but I cannot give up now."

Once more, he glimpsed the truth he had long pursued... Perhaps because his wish had finally been heard and heeded.
And at last, he uncovered the sinful path that opened into the pitch-black paradise.
Now, all that remained was for him to open the door — one that had shone in countless dreams — with his own two hands,
no matter the means, and no matter the price that had to be paid...
