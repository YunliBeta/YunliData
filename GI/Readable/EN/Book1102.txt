Oh my! A terrifying thing happened today! A passenger was attacked after dinner, and no one knows if they're alive or dead...



Perhaps due to worry, I hardly slept a wink. I got up to check on the children, only to discover they weren't in bed! My heart seemed to stop for a moment. I ran up to the deck to find the chief mate and had him inform the captain. He gave me a very peculiar look, as though he thought I were insane. Not that I cared how he viewed me — all I could think of was the children's safety.

After about ten minutes, the captain arrived. His tone was reassuring as he told me he was organizing a search. He assured me the children must have gotten curious and decided to explore the ship. He said there were only so many places they could be — it wouldn't take long to locate them. He completely ignored whatever beast it was that had taken that passenger — and was probably still nearby! It seemed like the children's safety would have to rely on me. I scoured every corner of the ship until I finally found Shalomiya beside a cargo crate in the hold. Thank the stars!

She seemed surprised to see me. I rushed forward and embraced her. Poor Shalomiya was wearing nothing but a thin sleeping gown — her hands were freezing. I took off my coat and wrapped it tightly around her. I rubbed my hands together and cupped her shivering cheeks, asking her if she knew where her sister was. She looked at me with an expression I can barely describe, but didn't say a word. After a long while, she raised her hand and pointed at the cargo crate behind me — it was locked from the outside.

When I opened that crate, I swear my heart skipped a beat. Inside was Sharmey, curled up on the floor. She must have been weak from being stuck in that airtight crate for so long. I stretched out a shaking hand and held it to her face — she was still breathing! If we'd have got here any later... I don't even want to think about what might have happened!

After taking Sharmey to the ship's doctor for treatment, I spent forever putting Shalomiya back to bed. The sky was already beginning to brighten, but I didn't feel tired at all — my mind was racing, trying to think what had happened. Who had locked her in that crate? What had the children done to warrant this sort of treatment?
