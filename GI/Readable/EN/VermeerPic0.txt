A part of the ballad Venti wished to find. This part reads: "Upon the land, the gods once set foot. To poets and bards, they revealed their faces: Endless radiance, formless beauty, just like you."
Upon the land, the gods once set foot. To scholars and sages, they unveiled their semblance: Star's glimmer, moon's orbit, just like you.
