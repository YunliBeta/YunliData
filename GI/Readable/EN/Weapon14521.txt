After the great tower of Shah Ramshahr finally fell like a honeyed-but-poisonous dream fading into the blood-soaked sands,
his kingly power passed through countless kingdoms as fleeting as the morning dew, then buried again and again beneath crimson and tears.
Beneath the sapphire dome, the nobles who once pledged allegiance to the tyrant broke free of the yoke,
only to follow false sages and be drawn into games of carnage and collapse amid the scorching sands once more.

O, the proud people of Tulaytullah who long forgot the silent warnings of the sages!
It was only when their ambitions faded along with the name of Gurkan that they came to know the true cost of rebellion.
By the time the brutal Khagans arrived on horseback, there were no more warriors guarding the Garden of Endless Pillars,
and like tamed beasts, those who dwelled in gilded dreams had no choice but to lower their heads before a new master once more.

Soldiers and tax collectors driven by insatiable greed came from distant lands to prey upon the already weary people.
Though the viridian court that claimed benevolence was ever so harsh to its people,
some among those subjugated beneath the iron hooves of a foreign tribe sought solace in a past amberized in poetry,
whispering praises of the brief reign of King Humayun in the cool shade untouched by the searing sun.

The young noble Goudarz stepped into the sacred hall buried deep beneath the sands, determined to free his fellow men from their shackles.
Legend had it that the palace belonged to the Ibis King, and that among the seven sage monks, the wisest was the shrewd and judicious scribe, who was also known as the secret emissary of the stars and moon.
But that desperate and nearly hopeless strategy stood little chance, for no plan could match the conqueror's forces, which blazed with the brilliance of the sun itself.
The wise men of Tighnar had long since fled, and that magnificent sanctuary of wisdom in the desert had already become buried beneath the iron-hued sea of sand.
Yet, from the depths of the dried-up spring, sacred and ancient echoes rose in answer to his prayers...

"O reckless child, o noble one, you yearn for the power of the blazing sun and the fury of sandstorms, and yet you dream the fool's dream of raising a tower from quicksand."
"Just as I give bitter and salty water to a thirsty camel, I can bestow upon you a power never before witnessed by either prophet or believer."
"However, the great master of the flowers and oases once left three riddles for the King Deshret, whom I served."
"But he, wise and sagacious as he was, could not answer them even before he fell into that poisonous dream."
"If you can lift the fog of confusion that has long plagued me, I will grant you power over the people as a gift."

The young Goudarz replied:
"Then pray reveal these ancient riddles, o wise one of the sacred edicts, writing, medicine, and wisdom."
"I shall offer a mortal's answer with the utmost sincerity and honesty, for there is no room for false shadows on my journey."

And so, the wisest of then all among the sage monks spoke thusly:
"What rises and falls in endless turns, perishing as soon as it rises, and never lasts?"
"Like the moon, it waxes full, then wanes away into the past."
"Both the wise and the foolish long for it, again and again,"
"but like the tides, it ebbs and flows within the hearts of men vain."

The young Goudarz replied:
"What you speak of is conspiracy and treachery. The robes of those who speak idly of virtue conceal nothing but festering weakness and lethargy."
"It is this very weakness that brought down the gem-blue dome, and it is this very weakness that has driven the people to cry out in sorrow."

The wise one burst out into laughter. Without directly addressing the answer offered by the youthful noble,
he handed the staff of falsehood to the young man nevertheless.

And this was how Goudarz's name became lost to history,
for it was replaced by the name of the mighty King Saleb Dowleh instead.
The warrior who would brook no lies in the past had gained kingly power through cunning,
casting a mirage of a golden age beneath the fading hues of twilight.

...

It was not until even the most perfect lie could no longer control the insatiable thirst for power,
not until even King Deshret's creations could no longer fabricate the illusion of divine manifestation,
and not until the voice of the Ibis King rose once more to ask him the very same question,
that the aged king gave his final answer amidst the laments of Gurabad:

"O holy one, all I speak are lies. Even I cannot trust my own words."
"The only thing I can do now is to fight to the death. That way, at the very least, I won't let the brothers who have come to my rescue down again."
"O, holy one, whether you seek truth or falsehood, you should taste it in your own blood."

The kingly power was subsequently seized by the Deys of other tribes, and on and on it went, until the various kingdoms were all whipped to dust by the desert winds.
As if he was accepting moonlight as amber as honey, the holy one had taken the king's last will as his final answer.
