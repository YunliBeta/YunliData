Those were the years when the soft, frosty light had shattered like a silver mirror, and a new moon had yet to rise.
The gods’ ancient blessing, like a lone spark on the vast tundra, eventually flickered out.
As the empty moon passed from the sky, the earth that couldn't become it began to wither.

Yesterday’s great deeds of miracle workers have faded into vaporous prayers, and those prayers are now the silent worries of the masses.

can hardly weave the flowing light into a song that moves the world, as her ancestors once did.

No matter how fervently the ancestors of the far north once vowed to follow their departed gods,
their descendants, mortals beneath the moon, live lives as fleeting as a flickering flame.
If, in the days long gone, one could still behold saints and officiants channeling the grace of the gods,
and if people still believed the new moon would one day rise from the shattered light,
then even when the last trace of grace disappears and miracles are no longer witnessed,
the line between so-called faith and so-called lies will grow as thin and fragile as the morning mist.

Legend has it that the antler crown worn by today's Moonchanter was a gift from the Frostmoon at the moment of its extinction.
The silver tree was broken, its white branches gone, and the priests pleaded for new mitres.
Out of pity, the mistress of the moon wove a holy crown for them with the flawless moonlight.

This is the very reason the last officiant chose to forge her circlet from cold, unyielding iron.
The young Lauvija was just a priestess then, and had never seen the moon’s blessing before,
and she dreamed that a comforting lie like this could still bind the unfaithful believers together.

Not until decades later, when the false crown sank into the foul, corrupt blood, did she finally see.
The reflection in her eyes was not the flawless moonlight, but the frigid night swallowed whole by her own shadow.
