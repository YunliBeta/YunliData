...From the records of the Frostgale Steeds: We received an urgent request for reinforcements from Piramida and set out for Kipumaki Cliff to deal with an unexpected Wild Hunt outbreak. According to our scout teams, there should be another group of Wild Hunt lurking beneath the cliffside camp.\n...It is now the third day. The Wild Hunt spilling out of Kipumaki Cliff has already reached the ramparts. That place is often called the Sanctum of Departed Heroes, the resting ground of soldiers who once fell in battle. The sheer number of Wild Hunt creatures this time is unsettling. I only hope I will not become one of them.\nThankfully, the scout has already returned to report to the old man in Piramida, so reinforcements should be on the way. Our orders are to clear three Wild Hunt nests. We destroyed one the day before yesterday, and another this morning after being forced into it. This should be the last one.\nIf we can hold out until help arrives, I can finally return to Piramida and make my report. I'm taking a long break once we get back... About time I headed home and checked on things there, too.
