Beyond the ruins of the ancient palace and on the edge of the wasteland stands the tranquil sacred forest of Lake Anvatinjarvi.
Legend has it that whoever breaks the golden branch in the forest will find the royal court of the Seelie, which is normally concealed from mortal eyes during the day.
A kingdom of the past, it lies forgotten by both time and space, hidden in a shadow where no heavenly light can touch it.
Its owner is long gone, leaving behind nothing but a neglected courtyard and a stripped-bare hall.
Yet, within the palace that should have been abandoned, a young womanâ€™s silent lament echoes among its walls.
"Once upon a time, the master craftsman of the skies once wove the destinies of all living beings, the golden harp his instrument of fate."
"This is the divine plan of the heavens. If we follow it, we will usher in happiness for the entire world."
"Yet even the ignorant can dream, and in her dream, a new future revealed itself."
"She saw men raise a tower to the heavens, and from its heights, saints waged war against the sky..."
"She saw roaring beasts, each one larger than a mountain, breaking free from the bonds of the earth..."
"She saw three moons casting their light upon the sea, a sight soon eclipsed by an ancient dragon rising like a tide."
"All that vanished the moment she awoke, as if it had never happened."
"All that remains is an indescribable glance from those eyes that are as bright as the stars."
"Is that love? Or is that just a delusion woven from hope, ambition, and a longing for death?"
"But that does not matter anymore, for their story is over in what is the final chapter of paradise."
"The chirping of the cicadas on long-past autumn nights was the earliest song of humankind, the song of the exiled."
"They had lost the place of their bodies and souls, with nothing left but songs and memories of the homeland they once knew."
The last singer and first Seelie played her final tune as she sat in the hall of the angels.
The wolf who once broke into this place has long since departed, leaving nothing but the unfulfilled dreams of those who continue to chase phantoms.
