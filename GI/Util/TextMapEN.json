Wriothesley blinked. When had he come into possession of this?\\nThe person at the desk — a stern-looking lady with a wrinkled face — gasped, before steadying her shocked expression, gripping her pen tighter. Her lips moved, and moved again, but at last closed.\\n\"She must have a lot of experience about living here,\" he immediately thought, and so he did his best to hold the Vision in his palm, before asking in a small voice, \"Miss, may I ask...\"\\nThe senior registrar did not reply. She took the slip of paper from him and looked coldly behind him, as if sizing up the next criminal who'd come to register. However, when she had finished filling the necessary information in, she had written something unnecessary in the margins of the documents she passed back to him. \"Hide it well.\"\\nWriothesley realized immediately that life at the Fortress would be even harder than roaming the streets.\\nHe felt fortunate that he had blocked everyone behind him from seeing what had happened, and more fortunate still that this kind-hearted registrar had been willing to give him a reminder. Sadly, he would not see her again, though this was no surprise, since staff turnover at the Fortress was quite high in those days.\\nThe first thing he did upon officially entering the Fortress was to quietly unravel a few threads of his clothing before using fine wire to sew his Vision into the space between the layers of fabric.\\nHe knew a thing or two about being homeless — certainly, that the biggest problem was never getting a hold of resources, but keeping them. People could not avoid sleeping, and occasionally being defenseless. The things you owned could be taken away with ease once you were asleep, and no one would call it a robbery.\\nAnd a Vision was no ordinary treasure. There were sure to be those who would be interested in it for various reasons, and Vision wielders were often magnets for ill-intentioned gazes.\\nIn the days that followed, his suspicions would be verified, for in gossip alone he heard of two to three Vision thefts. As for what happened afterward and the fate of the victims, various inconsistent rumors existed that Wriothesley pretended to pay little mind to.\\nHe still felt quite fortunate, of course, but it was hard to feel genuine happiness at staying safe off the backs of other peoples' tragic fates.\\nFor a long time afterward, he would pretend that he had not been favored by the gods, and in truth, it was not hard — merely a return to his scrappy past. He could handle that much.\\nThis persisted until a time when his age had nearly doubled, and he received an official invitation from the Palais Mermonia.\\nCommon practice dictated that citizens who were to receive an honorary title must attend an investiture ceremony, and said ceremony was said to be far more involved for the granting of a title such as \"Duke.\"\\nWriothesley tactfully declined attending the ceremony on the grounds of his unique duties, expressing the desire to simply sign and take the relevant certificates. Quite un-Fontainian of him, really, to dislike the spotlight and prefer to just muddle along.\\nMany workdays and much correspondence later, the Palais finally agreed.\\nBefore leaving the underwater stronghold, Wriothesley took his Vision up once more, for the first time in many years. Weighing it in his palm, he found it lighter than before, and smaller to boot. Finding a good spot on his clothes, he hung it there.\\nThe first to comment on it was the Iudex, who was to bestow the title upon him. Neuvillette's smile was suitably polite, but he somehow seemed more pleased than Wriothesley himself. \"Congratulations,\" said the Iudex. \"You have found something you wish to do at last, I see.\"\\nWriothesley smiled back by way of reply, but made no further comment.",

Given his age and constitution then, it was impossible for him to deal with a single adult, let alone more. As such, he was forced to try his luck on the streets, picking up odd jobs and doing apprenticeships, learning the art of lockpicking and the creation of small gadgets. He wanted to make sure that he would be well-equipped when he finally returned to destroy that accursed place.\\nHe fashioned a wrist-mounted device that could launch iron nails at high speed, penetrating any sufficiently soft surface. Unfortunately, it had limited uses, and lost all ability to function after a battle, just like him — and unlike him, it could not be saved.\\nIn the past, the underground pankration fights of the Fortress of Meropide had neither a fixed venue nor set rules. To win and keep earning, he had to constantly modify his gauntlets, because a trick you used once could be used against you the next time. Furthermore, even if he didn't render them scrap on the field, they could still be stolen or wrecked in some other way by others. He certainly had to start over countless times.\\nOnce he had the ability to garner better materials, his progress began to accelerate. He no longer needed to rely on chemicals to power the mechanism, and he would gain the support of professionals hailing from the Fontaine Research Institute. Those researchers enjoyed explaining the principles of mechanics to him even as they bellyached about all sorts of outrageous matters that occurred at the Institute. This, Wriothesley found fascinating — technological development increased the number of crimes that were committed, but they could also aid in solving them. Was that development then good or bad? That was hard to say.\\nAt that point, he no longer participated in matches all that often, with the gauntlets being saved for dealing with the trickiest of problems. They no longer took life, and instead brought him great praise and respect.\\nBut the people of the Fortress also know little of the crime he once committed. The only one who still remembers it like yesterday is Wriothesley himself. And no matter how much glory or repute he has earned, he still considers himself to be the same old Wriothesley he's always known.\\nNeither a good person, nor a complete villain.

Amid this lively atmosphere, everyone — apart from the birthday girl, the star of the show — racked their brains coming up with characters exceedingly ill-suited to themselves.\\nMelus, the steady hand, became the rash and careless commissioner, inviting all present to solve — or suffer under, more like — the ancient curse afflicting his family. Sonny, ever elegant in speech and etiquette, would play a potty-mouthed petty thief, even making the grand sacrifice of shedding his pale outer coat, which usually stuck to him like a second skin. The nervous rookie, Silver, having been dragged into this by dint of passing by, was made a mighty, mysterious mage.\\nThe most lethal blow came when Clorinde, who usually took charge of proceedings, decided to \"band together\" with the famed adventurer known as \"Demoiselle\" as a private doctor who missed every shot she fired. Someone had to do the healing, she reasoned — but alas, this left the role of game master open, with Callas unfortunate enough to be the only one left to fill that post. Thus was he forced to put his soft drink aside, and leave the audience stands (the bench) for the crowd of players (the sofa).\\nNavia was most pleased with this start.\\nThe game, however, got off to a bumpy beginning, with the strange commissioner bursting his way into Demoiselle's residence during her birthday party, only to misjudge and crash head first into a triple-layered cake, nearly drowning himself in dessert and ending the millennia-spanning family curse by his own hand within the first five minutes.\\nDemoiselle would quickly get the good-hearted doctor to save the man, with the doctor musing if letting him live on was tantamount to helping their enemies as she rolled the dice.\\nThe game master's expression did not change as he went faithfully about his duty in a low voice:\\n\"The young man, having braved the rain, was soaked to the bone, and both his hands were set a-trembling.\"\\n\"He did his best to clean the cream off his face and body, though he missed a few spots.\"\\n\"'Thank you, kind souls, thank you, for joining in my battle against this curse most wicked!'\"\\nThey were unusually lucky during the middle portion of the game. To solve a problem, one must investigate its source. According to the mage's hypothesis, the commissioner's ancestor must have made a contract with a demon for some reason. \"Ah, if I had only rolled higher, we would already know that reason...\" grumbled the mage. \"Bloody signed a high-interest contract without a care for his descendants, didn't 'e, the blithering idiot?\" The thief blurted out. \"Well then, can we steal the document and destroy it?\" Demoiselle asked offhandedly.\\nThe inexperienced game master would regret allowing their actions for all time, for the thief's luck was truly ludicrous.\\n\"...Demoiselle was clever indeed, and the thief just as profoundly skilled.\"\\n\"No one thought that the contract would fall into their hands so easily, and yet the words written upon it were nigh indecipherable...\"\\nThe ending, too, was unusually happy. Thanks to the hardworking and kind (and also sufficiently rusty) game master, Demoiselle would finally drag the rest of the party, riddled as they were with status effects, into a confrontation with the ancient demon. The battle was as chaotic as ever, with the mage losing his sanity first, and the doctor not landing a single shot. But just as everyone's hit points were about to bottom out, the adventurer Demoiselle would hazard a venture. Using up a turn to move beside the demon, and tanking a full round of its attacks head-on, she knowingly gave the doctor a desperate order, as everything was going to hell: \"Shoot me instead!\"\\nThe doctor's dice were rolled before the game master could say anything. Callas counted the dice in silence, before taking three deep breaths.\\n\"...The bullet pierces the demon's weak spot, and the giant creature collapses into the abyss.\"\\n\"It returns to the darkness, and into slumber, taking that absurd curse with it.\"\\n\"Rejoice, rejoice, for the adventurer's courage and for her ill-omened ally!\"\\nPerhaps it was to go with the President's flow or out of genuine emotion, but there was indeed much rejoicing. Amidst the din, only Callas, who had begun to sort out the various items used for play, was stunned. He retrieved a golden-yellow jewel from within the dice box.\\n\"Navia... I think this is yours.\"\\nThere were many people present, but this Vision did indeed belong to Navia, for it was with a flash of her thought that a great blade of Geo would slice her birthday cake in two... along with the table.\\nLater at night, when the party and her excitement both had settled down, Navia would lie on her bed, unable to remember what she had been thinking when she had obtained the Vision. Had her mind lingered on the final victory, obtained only after much struggle and hardship? Or had she wished that her birthdays henceforth would be spent surrounded by friends, just like this one?\\nIf it was the former, that seemed to obliquely indicate that a happy ending must be preceded by many tribulations... so best to go with the latter.\\nThus were her thoughts as she lay at dreamland's door, still clutching the Vision.",

Treacherous underwater currents, unexpected bodily reactions, and monsters lurking in the deep... Peril always comes without knocking. Seeking the help of a professional diver is always a wise choice.\\nIf you ask people who's the most talented diver around, you're likely to hear the name of Freminet. Even old veterans, bronzed and toughened by long exposure to the elements, never tire of lauding his skills. They speak not only of his familiarity with Fontaine's complex hydrological systems, but also of his prowess in coping with different underwater environments and seasonal conditions, as well as his expert control over his breathing. He seems to swim wherever he pleases — even through caverns deep down on the ocean floor, where no one else dares to venture...\\nWhen many people hear this, they suddenly think of something or other that Freminet could do for them. But no matter how great the promised rewards, the veterans always respond the same way — with a shake of the head and a regretful sigh.\\n\"The boy wouldn't hear of it... He's a nice lad, just a bit too shy.\"\\nThe conversation usually stops here.\\nAs Freminet sees it, other people's compliments are as capricious as the weather.

They hold a much dearer place in his heart than do reputation and reward, which float around on the surface. When he dives, he stays silent for long periods of time in the company of his old friends, and lets the silence swallow up his fears and anxieties. In so doing, he lets out all the things weighing on his mind, all the things that he can't say to anyone else.\\nThe reason he chose to dive was that simple — to find some peace and quiet, and escape everything happening in the world above.",

That idle exchange between Wriothesley and Clorinde was pure nonsense, just a bit of verbal horsing around to liven up an otherwise bone-dry business interaction.\\nHowever, while the title of \"Duke\" itself was not bought, Wriothesley's accession to administrator of the Fortress of Meropide cannot be separated from \"money.\"\\nCredit Coupons serve the role of currency within the Fortress. Here, Coupons are the medium of exchange, and this has been the case for a very long time, with only the details differing. When Wriothesley was incarcerated here as an inmate, trade in Coupons was much freer, and the range of items that could be bought more comprehensive. So long as you had enough of them in your pocket, you could obtain harmful drugs, know the winner of fixed matches, buy the hearts of people sitting on the fence, and even take away the right of others to continue breathing.\\nMany of these were extralegal trades, but even the official channels had their various special tricks, too. If you lacked private connections, you could only buy food and water at exorbitant prices, and your fortune slip would not be some adage of unknown providence, but real, practical, extra work you had to finish by the end of the workday. Coupons in those days resembled nothing so much as the previous administrator's tool for controlling inmates.\\nHurling lawbreakers into a lawless chaos to fend for themselves was indeed one way of doing things, but Wriothesley could not approve of it. He was perfectly willing to adapt to his environment, but if the environment was not suited for survival in the first place, then he certainly wasn't going to take this lying down.\\nHe spent a great deal of time accumulating capital in the underground arena and used that money to make still more. He was always the observant type, and was quite persuasive, too, not to mention humble and reasonable — so before anyone knew it, he had already accumulated more Coupons than everyone else in the Fortress combined.\\nThis accumulated wealth made him a man of high repute amongst his fellow inmates. And just as Wriothesley expected, the hammer of punishment soon came swinging down. In a single night, his Coupon account was emptied in one cruel stroke by the Fortress's administrator.\\nBut as noted before, Wriothesley had a knack for convincing others. Words have the power to incite, and so long as all residents of the Fortress, rich and poor, understood that they could suffer a similar fate under such management, they would speak up for him. And if he acted in a sufficiently upright manner in a sufficiently impressive setting, others would join with him to fill the void in their hearts.\\nAs such, he challenged the Fortress's previous administrator to a duel, in the name of fairness, justice, and order. Of course, their respective standings made poor grounds for this fight even at the best of times, but on that day, not a soul, inmate or guard, said a word in protest.\\nVery fortunately, said administrator's last-minute flight saved Wriothesley from having to get another person's blood on his hands. But unfortunately, that day was also the day he would have finished serving his sentence, but with the administrator missing, there was no one to sign his exit papers.\\nAnd so, he walked into the office in the middle of the Fortress, and took over all relevant duties.",

Using the network of information and connections that he has personally built up over the years, he can gain any intelligence or resources he needs from the comfort of his office.\\nHowever, he is also aware of one principle, which is that he cannot be imprisoned in that office by the host of duties that assails him, or he will either never get a good night's sleep, or soon find himself sleeping forever beneath the waves.\\nOnly two things are necessary for him to run this place comfortably: Mora and manpower.\\nFortunately, the Fortress itself is a giant factory, and he has quite the knack for making money — why, even the Palais Mermonia is one of his valued customers. Very importantly, giving the Palais some extra care is not considered to be hankering after power, and the Court of Fontaine for its part has little power of oversight over the Fortress, and thus simply represents valued customers and Mora — the more of both, the better. As such, Wriothesley is happy to comply with the Maison Gestion's exhaustively strict demands for proper documentation.\\n(The Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's incredible demand for Arkhium might have once made it a match for the Palais, but ever since the Institute became a mid-air tourist attraction, it has been forced to withdraw from the partnership. Till we meet again for another big contract, valued customer.)\\nOne of the most common pitfalls for the immensely wealthy is over-valuing money and undervaluing people. This is, again, where Wriothesley is a fortunate man, for he was not born rich, and thus knows how important it is to get along with others.\\nHe treats all who live at the Fortress equally. Be they criminals, guards, or ordinary staff, so long as they do what they should as they should, he will not nitpick.\\nBut as for those who overstep their station — well then, words must be had. The underwater space they dwell in is quite enclosed, and for most, there is nowhere else to go. If possible, of course, Wriothesley would prefer everyone to be reasonable, but where reasoned words fail, he will use even more persuasive means.\\nOccasionally overlooking the trivial, meaningless, but inevitable clashes between people is fair enough. Most people know better than to raise a real stink, while as for those who don't... there are places where they can go. Just as flowing water can cleanse itself, so can a functioning society get rid of its rot.\\nAs such, not only has Wriothesley not been worked into oblivion, he has even found himself significant amounts of free time.\\nOnce, the famous Champion Duelist Clorinde paid him a visit, and said this in passing: \"Why does it feel like you have even more free time than me? Your title wasn't bought, was it?\"\\n\"One moment, please.\"\\nSo saying, Wriothesley rifled through three drawers before producing several thick documents with a flourish. \"Now, let me see... 'excellent management'... 'leading tax contributor'... 'specially granted this title...' Well, what do you know? Good guess, that's pretty much what happened after all.\"",

Being well aware of this, Mavuika had long had the idea of constructing a multifunctional powerhouse of a vehicle.\\nIt needed to be both fast and sturdy, such that it would not be damaged while moving at high-speeds, no matter the circumstances.\\nIt needed to be able to traverse a wide variety of terrain, from cliffs to the water's surface, or even the skies. After all, in critical situations, the quickest path is always a straight line.\\nIt also needed sufficient explosive power, such that it could serve as a weapon when necessary. After all, in the event of an Abyssal attack, time spent tangling with monsters was time wasted.\\nThen, it had to be sufficiently compatible with Pyro, such that she could summon it with a mere flick of her wrist.\\n\"These are my requirements. Well within your capabilities, right, Xilonen?\"\\n\"Wha...?\"\\nEven by themselves, each of her criteria was difficult to fulfill. Put together, the task was truly outrageous. Even an artisan skilled as Xilonen thought Mavuika off her rocker, and understandably so.\\nBut Mavuika had come with much more than just a request. She brought also ideas with which to solve the problems involved — long had she been scouring Natlan for all manner of strangely-shaped Source Mechanisms as yet uncorrupted by the Abyss, along with various design blueprints of unknown provenance.\\nIn the distant past, the ancient dragons too had tried to fight against the Abyss. Their methods were exceptionally brutal, and as a result, they had built many a mighty device that relied on raw power to achieve victory. As for the blueprints, those Mavuika had copied by hand and brought with her.\\nIf the secrets behind the schematics could be unlocked, and the pre-existing devices reverse-engineered, and the useful parts disassembled before being recombined...\\nHaving considered things up to this point, Xilonen looked up at Mavuika's smiling face, and knew she no longer had any reason to refuse, nor did she want to — what artisan would willingly miss out on making such a creation?\\nThus the two of them joined forces to delve into the secrets behind the Source Mechanisms. In the process, they discovered that their original assumptions were too simplistic. It was impossible to get all the key components they needed from existing material.\\nThe solution, then, was to use modern smithing techniques to create said parts independently and combine the two elements — a process that involved lots of overheating and explosions en route to solving the Pyro compatibility issue that Source Mechanisms had.\\nAfter a long period of development, the prototype Flamestrider was at last complete. No one had ever seen such a beastly creation with such powerful capabilities before, and people lined up to see and applaud it.\\nThus did the leader who protects Natlan gain yet another guaranteed source of strength.\\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact that Xilonen declined to take part in the vehicle testing phase that followed, claiming that she had \"forgotten to make a second helmet.\" After all, sitting on the back of that thing while Mavuika is driving is a great way to end up feeling queasy.",
